| Visionary           | $0/week             | $100/month (max 2 Visionaries)                   | +15% payout; +30% once 44+ years old                                          |

Notes:
- Weekly $10 contributions are strongly encouraged for all members who are not Youth or Visionary.
- Director of Finance is responsible for ensuring the $50 × (number of family members) or monthly $150 investment is covered; if other members don’t pay, the Director must cover the shortfall.
- Visionaries pay $100/month separately for higher payout percentages.

2. Monthly Investment Purchase
-----------------------------
- Total contribution: $50 × (number of family members) or $150/month, divided among members who contribute.
- If a member refuses, the Director covers the remainder.

3. Payout Calculation Logic
--------------------------
Step 1: Calculate total fund growth
- Fund growth per month: 10% of total fund (investment + contributions).

Step 2: Base equal share
- Divide 10% of fund by the number of members, giving each member an initial base monthly share.

Step 3: Adjust for special types
- Elders: +20% of their own base share
- Visionaries: +15% if under 44, +30% if 44+
- Youth Members: -10% of their base share → put into private investment account

Step 4: Normalize total payout
- After adjustments, ensure total payout still equals 10% of fund.
- Adjust remaining share proportionally among regular members (they may lose some $ given to Elders/Visionaries or gain money from Youth losing 10%).
